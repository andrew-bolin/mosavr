Modular Open-Source Audio (Visual?) Receiver

I'm building a modular open-source AV receiver platform, with the following features
- Receive digital audio from TV via HDMI ARC
- Share control signals via HDMI CEC
- Multi-channel audio decoding and amplification
- Multiple outputs
- Apply DSP effects

Use-cases:
- Allow your TV remote to seamlessly control an existing analog amplifier/receiver
- Send a mono mixdown from your home cinema to the bathroom
- Room/speaker compensation
- Start with a 2.0 system, later upgrade to 5.1 

See https://hackaday.io/project/20469-modular-open-source-av-receiver for more detail on progress.
